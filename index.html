<p1 class="essential">I am learning HTML and CSS again.  This is my attempt at completing our first assignment.  Without futher ado, I enjoy poems, cats (pictured is my Cat, Socrates), games and books, generally.  Regarding my professional background, formerly, I worked in higher education. I have worked in Student Affairs (Staff Support, Financial Aid, Admissions), Academic Affairs (Tutoring and Instruction), and Libraries (Circulation). Also, if you aren't allergic, my cat Socrates will follow you to make sure you read!</p1> 
<p></p>
<p2 class="essential">As aforementioned, I enjoy poetry, and you can read my favorite poem below.</p2>

<h4>Music</h4>
<p5 class="essential">So, I am rather fond of music, as I anticipate many of you are reading this.  My favorite band is probably a defunct musical group from Canada called The Unicorns.  They had only one album <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?</i> It is as the Zoomer kids say "a banger," "a bop," and dare I may even say "fire." It is an excellent debut album.</p5>

<h5>Are You Still Reading This?</h5>
<p6 class="essential">Wait!  Are you still here?  You're lucky we've come a long way since the days of CompuServe, Usenet and its alts and newgroups.  By that I mean, you would have to pay-per-minute to read this pablum.  I am by nature somewhat wry and cynical.  Don't tell the others, but you were always my favorite! ;) In fact, you should consider the handy form down below!
